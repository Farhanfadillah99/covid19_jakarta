# covid19_jakarta
COVID-19 is a disease that has now become a global pandemic. The condition is even more worrying because until now there has not been found an effective vaccine for the virus that causes COVID-19. Governments in various countries generally form a task force unit to deal with the spread of COVID-19 in society, including the government in Indonesia.  One form of action taken by the government is to collect and provide data on the growth of COVID-19 cases to the public. The case growth data is often equipped with dashboards and supporting visualization charts in the hope that the public can understand the information more easily. An example is the covid19.go.id portal. In this project, i would like to analyze data for covid-19 issues in Jakarta.
